boostbyparallel
===============

The plugins provided by the APIs of this code will boost the performance of matrix operations by using OpenCL


<h1> ** Introduction ** </h1> 
The framework designed is to use the underlying GPU hardware available on your computer, to boost the performance of any piece of code, where parallelization is possible. 

The framework is undergoing development, is in the pre-alpha phase, and is available as per the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

<h1> ** How to run: ** </h1> 
The framework was started using the Visual Studio IDE, hence the build directory. Additional support and information will be provided soon, on how to run and setup the framework on any computer with the required hardware support. For those who are running Visual Studio 10, on a 64 bit machine, they can do the following steps: 

		1. Clone the boostbyparallel directory on to the destination folder on your local machine. 
		2. Run the clTut.sln file. This will open up visual studio. 
		3. Click on debug, or press F5 to run the code. 

Kernels for the parallelization software are provided in the folder named, *kernel*.
